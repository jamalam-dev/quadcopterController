# quadcopterController
A simple quadcopter controller implementation.

This is a simple quadcopter controller designed for raspberry pi and a Sparkfun LSM9DS1 breakout board. It is intended to run during flight of the craft. The repo quadcopterServer is the counterpart to this one, which reads a joystick and sends data to the controller.
